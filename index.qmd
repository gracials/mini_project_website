Hello! My name is Gracia Larsen-Schmidt. I am a senior at St. Olaf College majoring in English with concentrations in Statistics and Data Science, Race and Ethnic Studies, and Gender and Sexuality Studies. I run cross country and track collegiately and am the captain of my cross country team. I am a member and the president of Agnes A Cappella, the treble-voice a cappella group on campus. I work as a writing tutor and anthropology student researcher, and I am currently involved in statistics research on local adaptation and milkweed through St. Olaf's Center for Interdisciplinary Research.
