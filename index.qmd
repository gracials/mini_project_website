Hello! My name is Gracia Larsen-Schmidt. I am a senior at [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) majoring in English with concentrations in Statistics and Data Science, Race and Ethnic Studies, and Gender and Sexuality Studies. I run [cross country](https://athletics.stolaf.edu/sports/womens-cross-country) and [track](https://athletics.stolaf.edu/sports/womens-track-and-field) collegiately and am the captain of my cross country team. I am a member and the president of [Agnes A Cappella](https://www.instagram.com/agnesacappella_stolaf/), the treble-voice a cappella group on campus. I work as a [writing tutor](https://wp.stolaf.edu/academic-success/writing-desk/) and [anthropology student researcher](https://larsen1217.wixsite.com/my-site), and I am currently involved in statistics research on local adaptation and milkweed through St. Olaf's [Center for Interdisciplinary Research](https://wp.stolaf.edu/cir/).
