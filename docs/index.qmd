## Bio
Hello! My name is Gracia Larsen-Schmidt. I am a senior at St. Olaf College majoring in English with concentrations in Statistics and Data Science, Race and Ethnic Studies, and Gender and Sexuality Studies. I run cross country and track collegiately and am the captain of my cross country team. I am a member and the president of the treble-voice a cappella group on campus: Agnes A Cappella. I work as a writing tutor and am student researcher working with a professor of anthropology. I am involved in statistics and data science research on milkweeds and local adaptation through St. Olaf's Center for Interdisciplinary Research. Take a look around this website to learn more about the work I have done so far in Data Science 2!
