    "text": "The data for these visualizations can be found here on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Maternal and Infant Health page.\n\nAverage Percent Cesarian Deliveries By State 2020-2022 (static plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph is a map of the continental United States color coded with state-level data of the average percent of deliveries which were cesarean (c-sections) in the years 2020-2022, aggregated from county-level data. The average percent of deliveries which were cesarean varies from approximately 24% to 38%. The graph highlights that the South tends to have higher rates of cesarian deliveries, especially Louisiana and Mississippi, while the West and upper-western Midwest tend to have lower rates of cesarian sections.\n\n\nAverage Percent Cesarian Deliveries By State 2020-2022 (interactive plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage County Urban-Rural Code by State (static plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph is a map of the continental US color-coded at the state-level by the mean county urban-rural code. The mean county urban-rural code ranges from 2 (most urban) to 6 (most rural). States on the east coast have the lowest urban-rural code, meaning that the average of state’s counties’ urban-rural codes is the most urban. States in the South and on the west coast are next-most urban. The states that are the most rural are North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.\n\n\nAverage County Urban-Rural Code by State (interactive plot)"
