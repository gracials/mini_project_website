Generally, they seem to perhaps correlate with instances in which those words contained in the brackets might be emphasized.\nGiven that this symbol does not appear in most translations of the Quran, it is not necessarily a crucial point of analysis in comparing and contrasting the Quran with the KJV Bible. It does, however, raise an important point about symbols. In the original writings of the Quran and in many translations since, the text contains symbols which give instructions to the reader, such as a symbol indicating that the reader must not stop or a sign indicating that the reader should perform sajda, or prostration (“Rules, Signs, and Symbols in the Quran”). This is a major difference between the Quran and the Bible, as the Bible does not contain these types of symbols."

The original text of the Bible did not use quotations nor did the original Arabic of the Quran.\nIn modern, English translations, however, it is fairly common to include quotation marks as means to indicate speech and dialogue.\nIn order to include instances of potential dialogue in the KJV Bible, we will also add in our count instances in which the words “said,” “says,” “tells,” “told,” “asks,” or “asked” are used. Certainly there are other words which indicate dialogue and likely there are instances in which these words are connect to phrases which aren’t dialogue, however, using these words in addition to quotation marks gives us a rough estimate of the use of dialogic phrases.\n\n# creating a table to show the counts, totals, and proportions of dialogic phrases in ayahs/verses. \nholy_books |&gt;\n  group_by(title)|&gt;\n  summarize(sum(str_detect(text, \"\\\\\\\".+\\\\\\\"|said|says|tells|told|asks|asked\")),\n            total  = n()) |&gt;\n  rename(dialogue_count = 2) |&gt;\n  mutate(proportion = dialogue_count/total) |&gt;\n  rename(Title = title, \n         \"Dialogue Count\" = dialogue_count,\n         Total = total,\n         Proportion = proportion) |&gt;\n  kable()\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nDialogue Count\nTotal\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nKing James Version Bible\n3903\n31103\n0.1254863\n\n\nThe Holy Quran\n1276\n6236\n0.2046183\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce words associated with dialogue are included in the count, we can see that about an 8th of the verses in the Bible contain dialogic phrases while a little over a 5th of the ayahs in the Quran contain do. Evidently, dialogue and direct conversation plays a larger role in the Quran than in the Bible."

As the Quran progresses, the sentiment continues to bounce between positive and negative, but the variation in sentiment score gradually becomes smaller and smaller as it centers around zero.\nThe KJV Bible has drastic sentiment scores in the first half, with much greater drastic negatives than positives. Interestingly, the sentiment trajectory of the Bible corresponds with the delineation of Old vs. New Testament: the Old Testament of the KJV is constitutes books one through 39, and this is where we see very drastic variety in sentiment, particularly in numerous books with a large net negative; the New Testament, constituting books 39 through 66 are all positive except the very first, though it is worth noting that these positive sentiment scores are not as large as many of the negative sentiment scores of the Old Testament.\nOverall, the Quran’s net surah sentiment appears to trend towards net neutral, while the KJV Bible’s net book sentiment appears to begin drastically up and very down, and end on a definitely positive note."

Rather, it is meant to demonstrate that textual-level differences within religious texts can be made quantifiable and visual in compelling and creative ways. Using data science to investigate these holy books on the textual level pushes us to be imaginative about how we can make sense of religious texts in comparison with each other and how we might build upon initial exploration like this in order to find new angles to old analysis."
