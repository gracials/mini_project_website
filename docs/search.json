Generally, they seem to perhaps correlate with instances in which those words contained in the brackets might be emphasized.\nGiven that this symbol does not appear in most translations of the Quran, it is not necessarily a crucial point of analysis in comparing and contrasting the Quran with the KJV Bible. It does, however, raise an important point about symbols. In the original writings of the Quran and in many translations, the text contains symbols which give instructions to the reader. This is a major difference between the Quran and the Bible, as the Bible does not contain these types of symbols."

The original text of the Bible did not use quotations nor did the original Arabic of the Quran.\nIn modern, English translations, however, it is fairly common to include quotation marks as means to indicate speech and dialogue.\nIn order to include instances of potential dialogue in the KJV Bible, we will also add in our count instances in which the words “said,” “says,” “tells,” “told,” “asks,” or “asked” are used. Certainly there are other words which indicate dialogue and likely there are instances in which these words are connect to phrases which aren’t dialogue, however, using these words in addition to quotation marks gives us a rough estimate of the use of dialogic phrases.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nDialogue Count\nTotal\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nKing James Version Bible\n3903\n31103\n0.1254863\n\n\nThe Holy Quran\n1276\n6236\n0.2046183\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce words associated with dialogue are included in the count, we can see that about an 8th of the verses in the Bible contain dialogic phrases while a little over a 5th of the ayahs in the Quran contain do. Evidently, dialogue and direct conversation plays a larger role in the Quran than in the Bible."

In the Quran, the Divine is most often referred to as “Allah,” which is Arabic for “God.” In this translation of the Quran, Allah/God is also referred to as “Lord,” “God,” and “Almighty.” In the KJV Bible, the Divine is referred to as “God,” “LORD,” “Lord,” and “Almighty.” Because God is triune in the Bible (God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit), “Christ,” “Jesus,” and the “Holy Spirit” can also be considered references to the Divine in the KJV Bible.

The Quran too has its highest postivites and lowest negatives at the beginning, but these are much less drastic. As the Quran progresses, the text is largely neutral."
